DONE: User receives an email with verification link after registration
DONE Access token expires after [x] minutes of inactivity
DONE: The code is well-organized, properly commented, and follows best practices for the chosen programming language(s)
PROGRESS: Authentication options include email-password and at least 2 OAuth providers (Google/GIt +  1 more)



TODO: Password reset is handled via email
TODO: Verify functionality of 2FA


TODO: User cannot access protected routes without verifying email // no login without being verified.

TODO: New access token is issued when valid refresh token is provided // add token logic 
TODO: Verify receiving new access token by sending a request with expired access token and valid refresh token
TODO: Platform provides clear data usage consent with explicit user approval before data collection
        -At minimum, it includes what data is collected and how it's used
--        
DONE: (FE implement): Users can optionally enable two-factor authentication
DONE: Platform collects basic demographics, physical metrics, lifestyle indicators, dietary preferences and restrictions, wellness goals.

DONE: User data is encrypted in transit and at rest (https and User data encrypted in SQL)

TODO: At rest (https and User data encrypted in SQL) 
    
    -Encrypted at rest with pgcrypto
    -email
    -first_name 
    -last_name 

DONE: Platform collects initial fitness assessment data
TODO: Health metrics are converted to standard units before storage.

DONE: Platform allows user to change their data sharing preferences. ? what does this mean ? // Available to switch off AI.
DONE: Historical weight changes are tracked with timestamps
DONE: Verify each weight entry has a unique timestamp by adding multiple entries and checking their history display // all entires have time stamps
DONE: System prevents duplicate activity entries for the same timestamp: Time will be added as now.
DONE: Wellness score changes when user updates their weekly activity frequency
DONE: System recalculates wellness score components when any contributing metric changes


TODO: Verify scores update when changing: BMI range, activity level, goal, progress, or health habits


AI section

TODO: System generates different health insights when user's goals change
TODO: Verify insight adjustment after changing user goals from one type to another (e.g., weight loss to muscle gain)
TODO: AI recommendations include specific references to user's stated fitness goals

TODO: Verify recommendations explicitly mention and align with the specific fitness goal set in user profile
TODO: AI health insights exclude any personally identifiable information
TODO: System implements response validation to filter out recommendations that don't match user's health restrictions
    - Ask the students to describe their approach

TODO: System displays cached recommendations when AI service is unavailable
TODO: Verify system shows most recent cached recommendations when AI service connection is disabled


TODO: System generates weekly and monthly health summaries including progress and key metrics
TODO: Verify health summary includes week's activity levels, wellness score changes, and progress towards goals
TODO: Progress chart shows weight tracking over time, wellness score evolution and activity level changes

TODO: Goal progress includes milestone tracking
    Miles stone example:
        Weight: every 5% towards goal
        Activity: each additional day/week
        Habits: streak achievements
        Comparison view shows current vs target metrics, weekly/monthly progress comparison, health trend analysis and AI recommendations


TODO: Health Dashboard shows BMI, wellness score, progress towards goals and AI insights based on user data  // this is the User main header element.



TODO: AI insights are visually presented with priority-based highlighting -- Handle with markdown

TODO: Verify insights are displayed with high/medium/low priority indicators and include expandable details // dunno what this mean.

TODO: Weight progress chart displays goal weight as a reference line

DONE: Charts resize without data loss on mobile devices (feature in recharts)

TODO: Error messages appear without page reload when API requests fail

TODO: Submit health profile form with invalid BMI value (e.g., -1) and verify error message appears without page refresh //input error handling from FE not possible.


// Rate limit
TODO: System blocks rapid-fire API requests from the same user
TODO: Verify rate limit kicks in after [x] requests within 1 minute
TODO: Dashboard loads placeholder UI when data is being fetched



Extra
Quality of AI-generated health insights and progress evaluations during testing
Insights and evaluations generated are accurate, relevant, actionable
Relevance and practicality of AI-generated weekly and monthly health summaries and recommendations
System's handling of AI service limitations during testing (rate limits, availability)
Student has implemented additional technologies, security enhancements and/or features beyond the core requirements
