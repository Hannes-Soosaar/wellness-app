// LOGIN

User receives an email with verification link after registration
Authentication options include email-password and at least 2 OAuth providers
Password reset is handled via email
Users can optinonally enable two-factor authentication
Verify functionality of 2FA
User cannot access protected routes without verifying email
Student can explain the security implications of access token duration in JWT authentication
Access token expires after [x] minutes of inactivity
New access token is issued when valid refresh token is provided
Verify receiving new access token by sending a request with expired access token and valid refresh token


//GDPR
Platform provides clear data usage consent with explicit user approval before data collection
At minimum, it includes what data is collected and how it's used
Platform collects basic demographics, physical metrics, lifestyle indicators, dietary preferences and restrictions, wellness goals.
User data is encrypted in transit and at rest

//FUNCTIONS
Platform collects initial fitness assessment data


Health metrics are converted to standard units before storage
Platform allows user to change their data sharing preferences.
Historical weight changes are tracked with timestamps
Verify each weight entry has a unique timestamp by adding multiple entries and checking their history display
System prevents duplicate activity entries for the same timestamp
Wellness score changes when user updates their weekly activity frequency
System recalculates wellness score components when any contributing metric changes
Verify scores update when changing: BMI range, activity level, goal progress, or health habits
System generates different health insights when user's goals change
Verify insight adjustment after changing user goals from one type to another (e.g., weight loss to muscle gain)
AI recommendations include specific references to user's stated fitness goals
Verify recommendations explicitly mention and align with the specific fitness goal set in user profile
AI health insights exclude any personally identifiable information
System implements response validation to filter out recommendations that don't match user's health restrictions
Ask the students to describe their approach
System displays cached recommendations when AI service is unavailable
Verify system shows most recent cached recommendations when AI service connection is disabled
System generates weekly and monthly health summaries including progress and key metrics
Verify health summary includes week's activity levels, wellness score changes, and progress towards goals
Health Dashboard shows BMI, wellness score, progress towards goals and AI insights based on user data
Progress chart shows weight tracking over time, wellness score evolution and activity level changes
Goal progress includes milestone tracking

Milestone example:
Weight: every 5% towards goal
Activity: each additional day/week
Habits: streak achievements

Comparison view shows current vs target metrics, weekly/monthly progress comparison, health trend analysis and AI recommendations
AI insights are visually presented with priority-based highlighting
Verify insights are displayed with high/medium/low priority indicators and include expandable details
Weight progress chart displays goal weight as a reference line
Charts resize without data loss on mobile devices
Error messages appear without page reload when API requests fail
Submit health profile form with invalid BMI value (e.g., -1) and verify error message appears without page refresh
System blocks rapid-fire API requests from the same user
Verify rate limit kicks in after [x] requests within 1 minute
Health data export includes all historical metrics and timestamps
Dashboard loads placeholder UI when data is being fetched
The README file contains a clear project overview, setup instructions, and usage guide
The code is well-organized, properly commented, and follows best practices for the chosen programming language(s)


Extra
